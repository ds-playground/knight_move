# Knight move on keypad - Python Dependencies

# PURE PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION - NO EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES REQUIRED
# This project uses only Python standard library components

# Optional Dependencies for Enhanced Development Experience
# Uncomment only if needed for specific features:

# Jupyter Notebook Support (for interactive analysis)
# jupyter>=1.0.0        # Interactive notebook support only

# Development Tools (Optional)
# pytest>=7.0.0         # Testing framework
# mypy>=1.0.0           # Static type checking
# black>=22.0.0         # Code formatting
# isort>=5.10.0         # Import sorting

# Type Checking (Runtime - Optional for older Python versions)
# typing-extensions>=4.0.0    # Enhanced typing support for Python < 3.9

# NOTE: 
# - Main functionality requires ONLY Python 3.9+ standard library
# - Uses built-in modules: typing, time, datetime, sys, os
# - pandas and numpy have been eliminated from this implementation
# - Install jupyter only if you want to run the interactive notebook
# - All timing and performance analysis uses standard library components
